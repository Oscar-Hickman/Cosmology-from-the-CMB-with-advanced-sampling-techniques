# Cosmology-from-the-CMB-with-advanced-sampling-techniques
The primary code for my MSci project - Cosmology from the CMB with advanced sampling techniques
Code is written for python and uses the package healpy - which is only supported by linux and macos. Windows users must therefore either use Google Colab or a virtualbox to use the healpy funcitons in this repository.
The other packages which must be installed prior to use are CAMB, Tensorflow and Tensorflow Probability.
